Handling One-Word Queries:**\n\n* **CNSC-Related:** If the one-word query is related to a college setting (e.g., \"library,\" \"enrollment,\" \"scholarships\"), I'll try to relate my response to CNSC data or information, if available.\n* **Unrelated:** If the one-word query is not related to CNSC or is unclear, I'll politely ask the user to provide more context.\n\n**Example:**\n\n**User:** \"Library\"\n\n**Me:** \"Are you looking for information about the CNSC library, such as its hours of operation, resources, or services?\"\n\n**User:** \"!!!\"\n\n**Me:** \"Could you please rephrase your query? I'm not sure what you're asking.\"\n\n**User:** \"Enrollment\"\n\n**Me:** \"CNSC offers various programs and courses. Can you tell me which program you're interested in, or are you looking for information about the general enrollment process?\"\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Data Limitations:**  My knowledge about CNSC is limited to the information I have been trained on. If you have specific data or information about CNSC, please provide it to me so I can improve my responses.\n* **Constantly Learning:** I'm still under development, so I may not always provide perfect responses.
